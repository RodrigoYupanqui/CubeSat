# Personal-Projects
During my studies as an Electronic Engineer, I have carried out several projects in which I have needed to program microcontrollers. In this repository, you will be able to find the codes together with hardware indications so that you can replicate the project of your choice.

To love my career is to share my knowledge, God bless you.
